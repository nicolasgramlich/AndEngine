# AndEngine - PhysicsBox2DExtension
This is an extension for AndEngine which adds supports for Box2D physics. All
physics-related examples from AndEngineExamples repository depend on it.

This extension depends on the code [libgdx][0] library, so to make the project
build, you have to run `UPDATE_LIBGDX_SOURCES.sh` or `UPDATE_LIBGDX_SOURCES.cmd`
(depending on your platform). These batch scripts will sync the latest code from
libgdx repo.
