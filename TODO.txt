TODOS:
	- http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/3DDrawing/Conceptual/OpenGLES_ProgrammingGuide/TechniquesforWorkingwithVertexData/TechniquesforWorkingwithVertexData.html
	- Think about a way to update the Mesh of a Sprite more efficient.
		- Currently when updating the TextureCoordinates, the whole data array is sent to the buffer.
			- This could be optimized by not storing the data alternating (X0,Y0,U0,V0,X1,Y1,...) but in (X0,Y0,X1,Y1,...,U0,V0,U1,V1,...)
	- Find higher performance Matrix4f class?
	- Test if only unbinding a ShaderProgram if different one comes in improves performance.
	- Think about the default blendfunction (for sprites, but also for primitives).
		- For Sprites, keep premultiplyalpha in mind..
	- Eventually separate a TextureRegion from knowing what Texture it is on.
		- Makes it easier to switch textures during runtime.
		- Less disturbing when using multiple textures. 
		- Drawbacks?
	- All custom Exceptions extend from AndEngineException
	- Convert "IllegalArgumentException("Unexpected..." to "UnexpectedArgumentException extends AndEngineException
	- According to the Performance myths, pulling class attributes to local fields is not necessary anymore with the JIT.
		- As GLES2 is only available on JIT devices, this might be something to consider
	- I think I once wrote a commment to remove some legacy code when > 1.6. 
		- FIND IT!!!
	- FIND MORE LEGACY CODE AND GET RID OF IT =) *YAY*
	- TODO See if mediump precision and lowp precision make a difference. (cocos2d-gles2 seems to use lowp precision mostly).
	- Shadercache, as with the color in the VBO, shaders can be reused A LOT more easily !!!!!

EXAMPLES:
	- Replace: 
		- mEngine.getTextureManager() -> getTextureManager()
		- mEngine.getFontManager() -> getFontManager()
	- Blur/Bloom Shader?

	- Custom Text Mesh that shows how to color letters individually and make those colors change over time using a custom shader.
